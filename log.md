# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Tried *real* hard to get the centering and mobile layout working on the Frontend Mentor code challenge [Testimonials Grid](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7) and got no where.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with grid layout for both desktop **and** mobile. The only thing that came of today's work is that I need to spend some more time learning and practicing before I finish this challenge. I feel guilty and kind of small having to shelve a challenge but I think to avoid spending the next few months in one spot, it might be best to go back to the classroom for a bit. Maybe pick a challenge that is in the newbie tier instead of trying to take on junior level challenges just yet.
